üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone & setup project

pnpm install

Make sure you‚Äôre using pnpm and Node.js >= 18

2. Setup sub-apps

You can scaffold the apps like this:

‚∏ª

üîê Environment Variables

# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

‚∏ª

üí≥ Payments (for future)
	‚Ä¢	Uses Stripe Checkout to purchase ‚Äúlistening credits‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	15 minutes free; $4 = 20 minutes credit

‚∏ª

üìä MVP Success Metrics

Funnel Step	Goal
Visit ‚Üí Voice drop	‚â• 40%
Transcription pass rate	‚â• 95%
Inbox Echo ‚Üí Played	‚â• 80%
15-min host recharge rate	‚â• 15%
Infra cost / revenue	‚â§ 40%


‚∏ª

üß† Why Chamber.fm?
	‚Ä¢	Voice is warmer than text, but harder to scan
	‚Ä¢	AI makes it searchable, filterable, and safer
	‚Ä¢	Great for podcasters, coaches, long-distance couples, async teams

‚∏ª

üõ† Stack
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: Next.js + TailwindCSS
	‚Ä¢	Backend: NestJS + PostgreSQL + Redis
	‚Ä¢	AI: FastAPI + Whisper + GPT (via OpenAI)
	‚Ä¢	Storage: Cloudflare R2
	‚Ä¢	Payments: Stripe Checkout
	‚Ä¢	Deployment: Vercel (web), Render (API), GCP A10G (AI)

‚∏ª

üì¨ Example Use
	1.	A fan visits chamber.fm/artist and records a 60s question
	2.	AI summarizes it as: ‚ÄúFan asks about your next tour‚Äù
	3.	Artist sees the summary and listens to it, using 1 minute of credit
	4.	Artist optionally replies with a TTS response (future)

‚∏ª

üß™ Dev Notes
	‚Ä¢	Whisper is run on a GPU-enabled container
	‚Ä¢	GPT summarization is flow-driven via Windsurf (or raw OpenAI API)
	‚Ä¢	Inbox triage UI designed for keyboard-first quick review

‚∏ª

üßº To Do (MVP Scope)
	‚Ä¢	Record/upload voice widget (MediaRecorder API)
	‚Ä¢	STT + GPT backend endpoints
	‚Ä¢	Inbox UI with headlines and audio player
	‚Ä¢	Credit system integration
	‚Ä¢	Stripe checkout flow
	‚Ä¢	Basic email/push notifications

## üõ°Ô∏è Development Workflow & Code Quality

This project uses a set of tools and practices to ensure code quality, consistency, and a smooth development experience.

### Linting & Formatting

- **ESLint**: We use ESLint for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript and TypeScript code.
    - The `apps/api` service uses the modern ESLint flat config (`eslint.config.js`), which includes ignore patterns directly.
    - Other apps/packages may use `.eslintrc.json` and potentially `.eslintignore`.
    - To run lint checks for a specific app (e.g., `api`):
      ```bash
      pnpm --filter api lint
      ```
    - To attempt to automatically fix lint issues for a specific app:
      ```bash
      pnpm --filter api lint:fix
      ```
    - To run lint checks for all workspaces:
      ```bash
      pnpm lint
      ```
- **Prettier**: Code formatting is handled by Prettier, integrated with ESLint.
    - To check formatting for all workspaces:
      ```bash
      pnpm format
      ```
    - To automatically fix formatting:
      ```bash
      pnpm format:fix
      ```
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript is used for static type checking.
    - To type check all workspaces:
      ```bash
      pnpm typecheck
      ```

### Commit Hooks (Husky & lint-staged)

- **Husky**: Manages Git hooks to automate tasks.
- **lint-staged**: Runs linters and formatters on staged files before committing.
- **commitlint**: Enforces conventional commit messages.
- **Pre-commit**: Before each commit, `lint-staged` will automatically:
    - Run ESLint and Prettier on staged files.
    - If any checks fail, the commit will be aborted.
- **Commit Message Hook**: Before each commit message is finalized, `commitlint` will:
    - Ensure the message adheres to the Conventional Commits specification.
    - If the check fails, the commit will be aborted.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

- **GitHub Actions**: Our CI pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- **Key Checks**: On every push and pull request (targeting `main` or `develop`), the CI pipeline runs:
    - **Lint, Format & Type Check (Monorepo)**: Ensures code style, formatting, and type safety across the entire monorepo.
    - **Test AI (FastAPI)**: Runs tests for the AI service.
    - **Test API (NestJS)**: Runs tests for the main API service.
    - **Test Web (Next.js)**: Runs tests for the web frontend.
- **Branch Protection**:
    - The `main` branch is protected. Changes must be made via Pull Request.
    - All CI checks listed above must pass before a PR can be merged into `main`.

### Branching Strategy

- **`develop`**: Main development branch. New features and fixes are typically merged here first.
- **`main`**: Production branch. Represents the latest stable release. Changes are merged from `develop` to `main` via Pull Requests after all checks pass.
- **Feature Branches**: Create branches off `develop` for new features (e.g., `feat/my-new-feature` or `fix/bug-fix`).

### Contributing Notes

- Ensure you have `pnpm` installed (see "Getting Started").
- After cloning, run `pnpm install`.
- Use the provided scripts (e.g., `pnpm --filter <app> lint`, `pnpm format`) to maintain code quality.
- Commit messages will be validated automatically.
- All code is checked again in CI for safety and consistency.
