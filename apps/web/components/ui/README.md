# UI Primitives

This directory contains generic, reusable UI components that serve as the building blocks for the application's interface.

## Philosophy

-   **Generality:** UI components should be as generic and reusable as possible. They should not contain any business logic specific to a feature.
-   **Styling:** These components are styled with Tailwind CSS and can be customized via props.
-   **Dumb Components:** They are primarily "dumb" components that receive data and callbacks via props.

## Components

-   `Button`
-   `FeatureCard`
-   `IconBox`
-   `Section`
