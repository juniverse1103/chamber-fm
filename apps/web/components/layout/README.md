# Layout Components

This directory contains high-level structural components that define the overall layout and chrome of the application pages.

## Philosophy

Layout components are concerned with *where* content is placed on the page, not *what* the content is. They provide the shell for the application's views.

## Components

-   **`Header`**: The main application header, containing navigation and branding.
-   **`Footer`**: The main application footer.
