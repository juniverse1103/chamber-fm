# Components

This directory contains all the React components for the web application, organized into three main categories: `features`, `layout`, and `ui`.

## Directory Structure

-   **/features**: Contains complex, feature-specific components that encapsulate a distinct piece of application functionality (e.g., `voice-recorder`).
-   **/layout**: Contains high-level structural components that define the overall page layout (e.g., `Header`, `Footer`).
-   **/ui**: Contains generic, reusable UI primitives that are shared across the application (e.g., `Button`, `IconBox`).

## Path Aliases

All components should be imported using the `@/components/...` path alias to ensure clean, absolute imports.
