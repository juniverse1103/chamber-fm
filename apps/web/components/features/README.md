# Features

This directory contains high-level, feature-specific components. Each subdirectory represents a self-contained feature of the application.

## Philosophy

-   **Encapsulation:** Each feature should be fully encapsulated, containing all the components, hooks, and logic necessary for it to function.
-   **Independence:** Features should be as independent as possible from one another to promote modularity and reusability.

## Current Features

-   **/voice-recorder**: A complete voice recording and playback feature.
